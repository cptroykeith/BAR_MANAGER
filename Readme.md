Create a Python program that allows the user to manage an alcohol bar. The program should provide the following options:
Add a bottle to the bar
Remove a bottle from the bar
Purchase a bottle from the bar
Print the current inventory of the bar
Quit the program
When the user adds a bottle to the bar, they should be prompted to enter the name and quantity of the bottle. When they remove a bottle, they should be prompted to enter the name of the bottle they want to remove. When they purchase a bottle, they should be prompted to enter the name of the bottle they want to purchase and the quantity they want to purchase. The program should update the inventory accordingly.
The program should use a dictionary to store the inventory, where the keys are the names of the bottles and the values are the quantities of the bottles.
Here's a sample output of what the program might look like:
